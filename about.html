  <h1>Welcome to Planet Detroit Resource Hub</h1>
          <p>The hope for this site is that it will house links to relevant information for journalists, activists, academics, lawyers
            and anyone interested in learning more about the environment from websites, studies, and data. </p>

       <h3>Getting Data</h3>
          <p>Under the <a href="https://planet-detroit.github.io/data-hub/datasets/">&lsquo;Datasets&rsquo;</a> tab is the data catalog.

          <p>Alternatively, under the <a href="https://planet-detroit.github.io/data-hub/organizations/">&lsquo;Organizations&rsquo;</a> tab, you can browse organizations, and on the organization's page, you can search all their related datasets.&nbsp;</p>
